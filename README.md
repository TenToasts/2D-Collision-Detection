My Simulation and Modeling project where i do a collision of 2D objects. The primary focus is on ball physics.

I am using HTML5 canvas for this project.

Current status:
-Ball Collides with wall.
-New Balls are created after a certain interval of time

To add:
-Ball to collide with other balls.
-Add gravity and bounce physics (not sure)
